# GAME_PROGRAM-EX--2

# Create a player movement using character, collectable, player health and score

# Aim

Create a playable third-person character in Unreal Engine that can move and run, collect coin-like collectibles, track a Score and Player Health, and display both on-screen (UI).

# Overview:

1. Player Character (BP_PlayerCharacter) — handles movement, input, health, and overlaps with collectables.
2. Collectable (BP_Collectable) — simple actor with collision that gives score (and optionally health) when overlapped.
3. UI (WBP_HUD) — UMG Widget showing Score and Health values.
4. GameMode / PlayerState — (optional) hold persistent Score/HighScore across respawns.
5. Game flow — pickup increments Score, maybe plays sound/particle and destroys the collectable; health decreases on damage, and player dies or respawns when health ≤ 0.

# Step-by-step Implementation (Blueprint-first)
# 1. Project & Input Setup

Create a Third Person Blueprint project (or use your existing ThirdPersonMap).

Open Project Settings → Input and ensure these mappings exist:

MoveForward (W / Up arrow)
MoveRight (A/D or Left/Right)
Turn / LookUp (mouse)
Jump (SpaceBar)
Run (Left Shift) — optional if you want sprint

# 2. Player Character Blueprint (BP_PlayerCharacter)
1. Duplicate the existing ThirdPersonCharacter (or create a new Character blueprint) and name it BP_PlayerCharacter.

2. Variables to add (Expose where useful):

         Score (Integer) — default 0
         MaxHealth (Float) — e.g. 100.0
         Health (Float) — default equal to MaxHealth
         bIsRunning (Boolean) — if you want sprinting
3. Movement (in Event Graph):

        Use Add Movement Input hooked to MoveForward and MoveRight axis mappings.
        Use Turn and LookUp to rotate camera.
        If using Run: on Run Pressed set Max Walk Speed on the Character Movement component (e.g. 1200) and reset on Released (600 default).
4. Health functions:

Function: ApplyDamage(float DamageAmount)

   Subtract DamageAmount from Health.
   If Health <= 0 → call OnDeath event (disable input, play animation, respawn or show Game Over).
   Update HUD (call event to update widget binding).
Function: AddHealth(float HealAmount)

    Add to Health but clamp to MaxHealth.
    Update HUD.
5. Score management:

     Function: AddScore(int Amount)

        Score = Score + Amount → update HUD.

# BP_Collectable → OnComponentBeginOverlap (Sphere)
Other Actor → Cast To BP_PlayerCharacter

Branch (if cast success)

   Call AddScore(ScoreValue) on Player Character
   If GiveHealth > 0 Call AddHealth(GiveHealth)
   Play Sound at Location
   Spawn Emitter at Location
   Destroy Actor

# BP_PlayerCharacter → AddScore (Custom Event)
  Input: Amount (int)
  Score = Score + Amount
  Call UpdateScoreDisplay on the HUD widget reference
  (Optional) Play pickup sound, animate, or show floating text

# BP_PlayerCharacter → ApplyDamage (Custom Event)
   Input: Damage (float)
   Health = Health - Damage
   If Health <= 0
          Call OnDeath (Disable Input; show Game Over)
   Update HUD: Call UpdateHealthDisplay

# Result:
The AI character successfully roams within the defined NavMesh area, choosing random destinations at intervals using the Behavior Tree logic.
